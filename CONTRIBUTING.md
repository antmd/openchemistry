Contributing
------------

Our project uses GitHub for code review, and CDash to test the master branch
once changes have been merged. Please check our [development][Development]
guide for more details on developing and contributing to the project. The
GitHub issue tracker provides bug, feature and support trackers.

Our [wiki][Wiki] is used to document features, flesh out designs and host other
documentation. Our API is documented using Doxygen with updated
documentation generated nightly. We have several [mailing lists][MailingLists]
to coordinate development and to provide support.
